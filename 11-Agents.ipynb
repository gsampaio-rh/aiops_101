    "# 11. AI Agents and Automation: Integrating AI into Kubernetes Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this interactive introduction to AI Agents and Automation in Kubernetes! In this notebook, we’ll explore how AI can transform Kubernetes workflows by enabling real-time decision-making and proactive automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this as learning how to build an intelligent assistant for your Kubernetes environment—one that can monitor metrics, predict issues, and take corrective actions automatically. By the end of this notebook, you’ll integrate AI agents into your workflows and empower your cluster to operate with greater efficiency and resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand what AI agents are and how they enhance Kubernetes operations.\n",
    "2. Use AI models to predict workload surges and other operational challenges.\n",
    "3. Build automated workflows that take actions like scaling, healing, or reconfiguring services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn how AI-driven automation reduces downtime and simplifies operations.\n",
    "- Build an AI agent that integrates directly with the Kubernetes API.\n",
    "- See real-time decision-making in action, with tools that monitor metrics, predict issues, and resolve them autonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are AI Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents are autonomous systems designed to:\n",
    "1. Monitor: Continuously analyze Kubernetes metrics, logs, and environmental data.\n",
    "2. Reason: Use predictive models to anticipate problems or optimize resource allocation.\n",
    "3. Act: Trigger specific actions via Kubernetes APIs, such as scaling deployments or cordoning nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![agentmodules](images/agent_modules_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Are AI Agents Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes environments are dynamic and complex, with workloads that can change rapidly. Traditional monitoring tools require manual intervention to:\n",
    "- Scale services during traffic surges.\n",
    "- Mitigate issues like node failures or pod misconfigurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents simplify this by:\n",
    "- Acting proactively instead of reactively.\n",
    "- Automating routine operations to reduce manual effort.\n",
    "- Enhancing system resilience and uptime.\n",
    "\n",
    "![agenticvnonagentic](images/agentic-vs-non-agentic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Real Example: Handling Traffic Surges\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine running an e-commerce platform on Kubernetes. During a flash sale, traffic surges unexpectedly:\n",
    "1. Without AI Agents:\n",
    "   - Ops teams scramble to monitor metrics, manually scale services, and address bottlenecks.\n",
    "   - Delays in response lead to slower user experiences or downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With AI Agents:\n",
    "   - The agent detects a spike in traffic early using predictive models.\n",
    "   - It automatically scales pods and adjusts resources to meet demand, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging AI agents, your cluster becomes smarter, faster, and more efficient—handling challenges with minimal human intervention.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Simulating Data and Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we set up mock functions to simulate real-world data and actions. These functions are then wrapped as **tools** using LangChain, making them accessible to our AI agent for decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are LangChain Tools?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain tools are modular components that allow AI agents to interact with external systems or perform specific actions. They act as the **hands** of the AI agent, enabling it to fetch data, analyze information, or trigger actions. Each tool has a clear purpose, making it easy to define workflows for the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools We’ll Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Financial Data Tool**:\n",
    "   - Simulates financial metrics like trading volume and price changes.\n",
    "   - Helps the AI agent identify external factors (e.g., market surges) that may affect workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Kubernetes Metrics Tool**:\n",
    "   - Simulates resource usage (CPU and memory) for a Kubernetes service.\n",
    "   - Provides the agent with system insights to assess current performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scaling Action Tool**:\n",
    "   - Simulates scaling Kubernetes services, such as adding or removing pods.\n",
    "   - Demonstrates how the AI agent can act on predictions or detected issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these tools, we create a framework where the AI agent can:\n",
    "- **Monitor**: Fetch data using tools like the financial and Kubernetes metrics simulators.\n",
    "- **Reason**: Analyze the data to detect patterns or issues.\n",
    "- **Act**: Take corrective actions using the scaling tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "![React Agent Architecture](images/react_agent_architecture_modules.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next step, we’ll initialize these tools and integrate them with the AI agent for an interactive demonstration.\n"

    "## Step 3: Setting Up the AI Agent with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve defined and wrapped our mock functions as tools, it’s time to integrate them into an AI agent. This agent will use the tools to monitor data, reason about it, and take actions, all driven by a powerful language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of the Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Language Model (LLM)**:\n",
    "   - We initialize the **Ollama LLM** (`llama3.1`) as the brain of the agent. This LLM processes prompts, reasons about data, and decides which tools to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tools**:\n",
    "   - The tools we defined earlier are passed to the agent, enabling it to:\n",
    "     - Fetch financial data.\n",
    "     - Retrieve Kubernetes metrics.\n",
    "     - Simulate scaling services.\n",
    "   - Each tool has a name, a function, and a description to help the agent decide when to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Agent Type**:\n",
    "   - We use a **ReAct (Reason + Act)** agent type, which allows the agent to:\n",
    "     - Think step-by-step.\n",
    "     - Use tools dynamically based on the situation.\n",
    "     - Generate responses with clear reasoning and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent processes a user-defined prompt (we’ll see this in the next step).\n",
    "- It determines which tool to use based on the context.\n",
    "- After using a tool, it observes the result and decides the next step.\n",
    "- This loop continues until the agent reaches a final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "![React Flow](images/react_flow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this setup, our agent is ready to demonstrate its ability to monitor Kubernetes metrics, analyze financial data, and simulate actions dynamically."
